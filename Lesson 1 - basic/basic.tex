%This is an example of a comment. Anything followed by a percentage sign is ignored by the compiler.
%Comments are used to annotate your code

%Start of preamble
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article} %This line should always be at the top
\usepackage{parskip} %The parskip package is very important in my opinion. It allows a blank line to constitute a paragraph break
%End of preamble. The preamble is where you add packages and set options for the file

Hello World!

This is an example of a basic document. A \LaTeX\ document is created by making a text file with the code for the document. Then a special program, called a compiler, processes the text file and produces the output.

The default output format produces a ``.dvi'' file, but most of the time, you want a ``.pdf'' file. To do this, you must use ``pdfTex'', which is one of the many compilers available for \LaTeX.

The margins are quite wide here, as this is the default setting in \LaTeX. To change this, use the \texttt{geometry} package as shown in the ``margin'' example.

Make sure you read the comments in the code for this document.
