\usepackage[margin=2.5cm]{geometry}

\begin{document}
Here you can see that the margins have been changed. The margin on the left is much wider than the margin on the right. The margin on the top has been made very small.

If you want to set all four margins to the same size, put the following in the preamble: %fwhfowejhfihjfiuawhefiuwhfeiwahf

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[margin=2.5cm]{geometry}
\end{verbatim}

This sets all four margins to be 2.5 cm wide.

\end{document}
